## Scenario

Your tech lead has become tied up dealing with last minute issues on another project, and has asked you to step in and complete a piece of work for one of your loyal clients, “Cat Couture”.

Cat Couture is an online shop that specializes in the latest cat fashion. The client has asked for:

- A pagination feature, so that their customers can better view and link to the increasing variety of costumes that the shop now stocks
- An area of the site where their administrator can to log in and:
  - See the number of cat costumes in each product category that the shop sells
  - See the number of different products that are on promotion

Your tech lead has also warned you about some existing technical debt that you will need to fix.

---

## Brief

Implement the requested functionalities for stakeholders of the Cat Couture website, using the new full stack skills and development best practices you have learned.

## Instructions

### Part A - Planning

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Read through this project and get an idea of work that you will need to implement.

To plan, organize and prioritize your work you will use GitHub Issues and a GitHub Project board. You do not need to implement each project part in the sequential order of Parts B-K. You will need to break down your work into small, manageable pieces.

You may end up with several GitHub Issues that make up one project part (eg. breaking down the Pagination section into several issues), and issues which contain work from a combination of the different project parts (eg. one issue containing both testing requirements and implementation of functionality).

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Each piece of work required is captured in a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).
2. A [GitHub Project board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards) is used to visualize your work.
3. Only one issue is In Progress at any given time.
4. Each GitHub Issue contains acceptance criteria/test cases.

</details>

---

### Part B - Tests

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

Your tech lead has already added some tests in anticipation of the new functionality being implemented. Check that these tests pass once your work on the shop has been completed. You are also allowed to modify the existing tests as long as they are meaningful changes.

To improve the maintainability of the application, implement the todo Unit Tests and Integration Tests.

Include an appropriate test plan for each GitHub Issue.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The acceptance criteria for the Pagination and Content Access GitHub Issues need to use the GIVEN, WHEN, THEN format.
2. GitHub Issues for Parts D to J each contain a test plan outlining how the feature/task/bugfix will be tested.
3. All client-side todo automated tests are correctly implemented.
4. All client-side automated tests are meaningful and pass.
5. All server-side todo automated tests are correctly implemented.
6. All server-side automated tests are meaningful and pass.

5. [Pull requests include a description](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/) explaining the changes made and have the tech lead and teaching assistant added as [reviewers](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).
6. Pull requests have comments added to ask for help/feedback, if needed. A clear description of any issues is provided.
7. You should acknowledge all feedback given on pull requests and action the feedback given appropriately.
8. The project is submitted correctly in GitHub with code merged to the `main` branch before the deadline.
9. The project is turned in on Google Classroom.
10. [Feedback](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5t9C5wsMNN7uDKTKvY6W7jKMU_9OE00KWnSjr3OCMS5Qj-w/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1220290274=Project&entry.1443355662=Cat+Couture) has been completed.

### Part D - User Experience

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

To improve the user experience design wireframes for:

1. The product page, taking into account the layout required for pagination and `on promotion` products.
2. The dashboard page where the admin can:
   - See the number of different products in each product category.
   - See the number of different products that are on sale.
3. Use your wireframes when you implement and style the app.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Wireframes are created. Screenshots or images of the wireframes are added to the [wireframes folder](./wireframes/wireframes.md). The wireframes consider different breakpoints for responsive design for mobile and desktop sizes.
2. The products on the product page are visually laid out in a grid-like arrangement.
3. On the product page the products on promotion "stand out" from the non-discounted products.
4. The web application is 
  using CSS and is responsive.
5. The design layout matches the wireframes, including responsive design.
6. There are no violations of [design principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5KYlHNKQB8).
7. The HTML generated from the React app is [valid](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and [semantically correct](https://html.com/semantic-markup/).
8. The CSS is [valid](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). Class names are meaningful. No unused CSS rules or properties are left in the project.

### Part E - Database Diagram

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

To improve the developer experience and maintainability of the shop, create an Entity-Relationship Diagram which accurately reflects the database schema.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. A database diagram is created. A screenshot or an image of the diagram is added to the [diagrams folder](./diagrams/database_diagram.md]).
2. The database diagram accurately reflects the database schema.

</details>

### Part F - Fix Warnings

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>
  
Unfortunately, there appear to be some warnings showing up in the terminal and browser console when the app is run. Raise a bug in GitHub to address the problems. Prioritise and fix it accordingly.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. Bugs addressing each of the warnings in the terminal and the browser console are raised via GitHub Issues.
2. Each bug issue contains a detailed description of the problems that are occurring.
3. Each bug issue contains acceptance criteria of how it will be known when the problems are fixed.
4. The problems have been fixed and the bug GitHub Issues have been closed.
